    <pre> <h3>
        Soobin visited Yeonjun’s apartment often after their first time together. He wasn’t really sure what they were meant to be. 
        Maybe they were friends with benefits, but there were more benefits than
friendship.

It’s not like they didn’t try to talk. Yeonjun always invited him to “hang out”. He’d brew a few cups of tea or prepare some coffee.

 He’d serve the warm beverage on his best mugs. More often
than not, the mugs remained full. Soobin was usually the first to break the tension and crash his lips against Yeonjun’s, uncaring of the hot tea that waited to be drunk.

“I have a low battery. Can you lend me your charger?” Soobin asked one of those days, before the situation escalated.

He had tried to charge his phone before leaving, but the shower he had taken hadn’t lasted long and that was the only time he had put it to charge that day.

He was too impatient to wait for something so silly, when he could be at Yeonjun’s getting dicked down.

“Yeah. On the wall next to my bed.”

Yeonjun stood next to the table, serving the coffee he had prepared. At this point, it was only a formality.

 Both of them knew they wouldn’t last long enough to drink it

Soobin knew the socket Yeonjun mentioned. It was next to the mattress. Yeonjun often left a few inches of space next to it, enough to charge his phone.

 Soobin hadn’t paid much attention to it, but he vaguely remembered where it was.

He peeked on the empty space between the mattress and the wall and he found it. He connected his phone to it and frowned when he saw something strange on the floor. 

A sock maybe? Some sort of clothing?

He stuck his hand down there and blindly searched for it, trying to do Yeonjun a favour. He took it out, smiling victoriously. 

He blinked with surprise at what he found.It was a rag. And not any rag.

The rag in question was gray, and not too big, dried up in a weird shape. He could recognize what it was, the substance that stuck to it.

 He had seen it on his own underwear hundreds of times before,
on the days something happened that triggered the physiological response of sexual arousal on his body.

Yeonjun had kept the dirty rag. The one he had used the first time he modelled for the older boy.

“Yeonjun,” he called. He had turned to stare at him, but Yeonjun was leaving the kettle on the kitchen counter, paying no attention to him. “ Yeonjun ,” he said sternly. 

Yeonjun finally looked at him, surprised at the tone Soobin had used on him. He was usually a little bit shy, and much more respectful…

“What is-?” Yeonjun had tried to ask but the words died in his throat when he saw what Soobin was holding. Oh, fuck , he internally cursed. 

He had forgotten about that. He had used the rag a couple of times before their second session. 

He probably jerked off and threw it to the hole by his bed, in a sleepy haze.

“This is what I think it is, isn’t it?” Soobin interrogated. Yeonjun didn’t know what to answer. He swallowed, frozen like a deer caught in the headlights. 

Soobin laughed breathlessly. “Clear the table for me,” he ordered.

Yeonjun was too stunned to do anything else besides following his orders. He put the mugs on the sink and the rest of the things on the kitchen counter. 

He wasn’t sure what was going on. 

Was Soobin going to reject him? Leave and never come back now he knew how much of a pervert Yeonjun was?

Yeonjun stood in front of the table, awkwardly scratching his elbow.

“Why did you use this for?” Soobin asked, waving the rag on his face, a couple of feet away from him.

Yeonjun blushed. “I…” Could he confess the truth? “I’m sorry.”

Soobin laughed breathlessly. “Did you hold it to your face and jerked off?” Yeonjun nodded <abbr title=" an outwardly shy or modest way that is intended to be alluring:"> coyly</abbr>

and avoided his gaze, but Soobin wasn't having it. He pressed the dirty rag against Yeonjun's nose. "Like this?"

Yeonjun stared in shock at him. He breathed in slowly. The cloth barely held traces of Soobin's scent. It mostly smelled like the dust that had been recollected under his bed.

Soobin threw the rag somewhere in the room, allowing Yeonjun to breathe freely.

Soobin took his shirt off and dropped it on the floor. Yeonjun gasped. He hadn't expected Soobin to undress and was very confused but there wasn't enough 
blood in his brain to think now that Soobin's torso exposed for him to see. He was as hot as always. Then he got rid of his pants as well and Yeonjun was sure he
 was more than a little turned on already, despite his daze.

Yeonjun took the sight in front of him. Soobin was only wearing panties (pink as always, Yeonjun had the suspicion the sculptor was aware how sexy he found them) and socks.
 The socks didn't match, Soobin had been in too much of a hurry to leave to even check, but Yeonjun cared little about his socks.

Soobin smiled dangerously and pushed Yeonjun down, until he was sitting. Soobin settled on the table in front of him and played with Yeonjun's lower lip (he had pierced it,
 and Soobin had been infatuated with the little metal piece ever since).

Soobin shook his head, pretending to be disappointed and not incredibly horny as he was. "I didn't expect you to be such a pervert.
 Imagine what your friends would think if they found out that you used that dirty rag to masturbate." 
 He put a foot down on the chair, between Yeonjun's legs.
  "What would the student body think of you if they found out?"

Yeonjun sputtered, unsure of what to respond. He didn't want to admit it, but Soobin bei. mean to him affected greatly. He tended to be sweet and needy, 
now he was making Yeonjun ashamed of himself, of his past actions. It was so degrading, for his dirtiest secrets to be thrown on his face like that, and so fucking arousing.


"I don't know," Yeonjun said. Soobin wouldn't say anything, he knew he was just teasing but the idea was terrifying. Would they be creeped out? Or point fingers at him and laugh, in the same way Soobin had laughed at him minutes prior?

Soobin giggled. He lifted his butt from the table to take his panties off. They slid down his long, toned legs. He grabbed them and toyed with them, 
spinning them on his index finger.

“Wonder if a pervert like you is also turned on by underwear?” Soobin said.
Yeonjun didn’t know what face he was making, but with one mere look at his expression Soobin had the answer.

“I always had a hunch you liked my panties a little too much, but never had any confirmation.” Hesmirked, clearly enjoying Yeonjun’s nervous expression. 
He’d use that information for evil purposes.

 “They are much wetter than the rag, too.” Yeonjun was so hard it hurt. He whimpered when sock-clad toes dug on his crotch.

His head was yanked back, so he was in Soobin’s direct line of vision and couldn’t escape. Then Soobin forced his panties between his lips, the wet spot cold against his lips.
Yeonjun’s eyes rolled back as his mouth was stuffed by the fabric. He could savour Soobin’s slick on his tongue.

Soobin touched himself, rubbing his nipples with one hand and fingers gliding between his folds with the other. It felt good, not nearly as good as when Yeonjun did it, but the boy 
was too busy right now, occupied with the task of sucking Soobin’s panties clean.

The ball of Soobin’s foot was dragged against Yeonjun’s cock, offering some friction. If it wasn’t for the panties on his mouth, he’d be drooling. 
Soobin looked gorgeous, pleasuring himself only inches away from where Yeonjun was sitting. Soobin’s half-closed eyes took in the messy state

Yeonjun was in, looking down with adoration and lust. Yeonjun was sure his gaze reflected the same reverence.

The boy that sat in front of him, with his open legs and his dripping pussy and his loving eyes was worthy of worship. He spat the underwear out. 
Yeonjun didn’t know if that would annoy Soobin but he needed to tell him just how beautiful he found him.

“You’re so amazing, Soobin.” Yeonjun kissed his knee and Soobin’s foot trembled against his dick at the tender action. “You’re so hot,
 I could come just by seeing your face.I’m a second away

from combusting every time you look at me.” He sighed, afraid of overwhelming Soobin but incapable of shutting up. “I’m a weak, weak man. I’ve already told you, I can’t help 
being a pervert when it comes to you.”
